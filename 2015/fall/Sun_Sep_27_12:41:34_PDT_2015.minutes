Decisions made:

Second project of the quarter will involve buying Raspberry Pis
and programming them in Python. We will provive networking
capability in the classroom via an ethernet switch.
Keyboards and mice can be commandeered from existing computers
in the classroom. We will also be buying inside-the-case screens
so that can easily communicate with the Pis.
